# 2 - Out Of Hand

Don't wanna have to take your shit anymore
I've finally concluded that life is way to short
Oh, the ticking of the hourglass,
The tiny grains of sand
It beckons me like gravity,
Like signposts on the land
And you've got what you wanted
Without force or reprimand
The seconds are all running out,
This burden's out of hand
