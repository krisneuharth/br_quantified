# 3 - Waiting For The Fire

Two young lads on distant shores
Tending to the rigors of their daily chores
Their parents tell them what's going on
And they're waiting for the fire

Two young men on distant shores
Tending to the rigors of their social norms
The news reel tells them what's going on
And they're waiting for the fire

Waiting for the fire
The heat is rising and their tongues are getting drier
The culmination of an ancient time
They are waiting for the fire

Waiting for the fire
They are waiting for the fire
