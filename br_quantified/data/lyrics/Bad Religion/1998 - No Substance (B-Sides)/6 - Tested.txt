# 6 - Tested

Yeah, they say there's a place free of trouble and care
And you have to pass a test for to make it there
It has something to do with the road that's straight and narrow
And the only way to go it is by being right and thorough

There's always one more hill to climb
There's always one more hill to climb
Bombarded by multiple choices 24/7
Navigating a tangled web of logic and passion
Guided by subconscious voices, astute and sharpened
Tested, tested

Often times we may be wonder what we're supposed to do
Stand and deliver or see the conflict through
And as we long and proceed to build our castles in the sky
Our plans get confounded and determination dies
There's no preparation and no guide
Just what you've done before here with your life

Bombarded by multiple choices 24/7
Navigating a tangled web of logic and passion
Guided by subconscious voices, astute and sharpened
Tested, tested oh oh oh

Acting on will, (the test is the reaction)
Opening your heart, (the test is the emotion)
Rolling the dice, (the test is the agility)
Burning out your mind,(the test is the recovery)
Watch-out!

You can play by the rules or bend them to your needs
But the test isn't over till you reach your dark eternal sleep
There are no absolutes, no big wheels in the sky
You don't have to be first just gotta somehow get by

Yeah bombarded by multiple choices 24/7
Navigating a tangled web of logic and passion
Guided by subconscious voices astute and sharpened
Tested, tested oh oh oh
