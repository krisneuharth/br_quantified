I know I'm part of something greater than myself
Don't know the meaning but I hope that matters less
I don't know anything when I'm factored out of scale
I know I'm part of something greater than myself

We're all engaging in a game of attrition
Maybe god is just a chemical fiction
Chemical fiction
I'm a monkey with a madding affliction
Fact checking for a mental condition
A mental condition

I know I'm part of something greater than myself
Don't know the meaning but I hope that matters less
I don't know anything when I'm factored out of scale
I know I'm part of something greater than myself
